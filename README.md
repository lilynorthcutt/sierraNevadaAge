  <h3 align="center">Flow Through the Ages: Geologic Age Prediction in the Sierra Nevadas</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Welcome! This collaborative project aims to innovate rock age prediction using machine learning models. 
    Our goal is to predict unknown rock ages and use these predictions to better understand magma migration patterns 
    in the Sierra Nevadas.

## About The Project 
The main goals of this project are to accomplish the following:
*  __Develop novel machine learning (ML) methods__ to fill gaps in geologic 
maps by predicting undated rock ages.
* __Apply the results from the model__ to fill gaps in geologic maps
by predicting undated rock ages.
